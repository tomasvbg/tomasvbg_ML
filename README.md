Analyst with seven years of experience in strategic cabinets, both in the public and private sectors. During the last years I have developed my career in the IT sector as a product manager, where I have been able to work with different teams, contributing through the analysis of business models, the creation of minimum viable products, the development of marketing strategies, the creation of of data models, and the discovery of descriptive and predictive business metrics for the implementation of Business Intelligence tools, always from the business side.

In 2020, working with analysts focused on BI tools, data warehousing and machine learning, I began to understand that although value metrics were generally found by a business analyst, it was essential to understand more about the work of technical analysts in order to be able to make the most of the data collected by the different applications. In march of that same year, I started a professional Python course that covered web development, database creation and management, and the current implementation of machine learning algorithms - 10 months- (notebooks and study material on my GitHub).

I understood that to truly learn the technological tools and mathematical knowledge I had to dedicate myself for a year full time. That is why at the beginning of the year 2021 I started a full time Bootcamp applied in data science -10 months- (notebooks on my GitHub).

I currently have the ability to create, train, tune, and deploy supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning models in Jupyter Notebooks and to extract information from databases using SQL. However, I am preparing for the AWS Machine Learning certification so that I can integrate the above in the cloud.

I would love to join a company where I can contribute from the experience as a business analyst acquired throughout my career as a product manager and the technical and analytical tools of the world of data science learned during 2021.

This folder contains:
 
i) jupyter homework notebooks I have done this 2021 within the framework of the different courses I have taken in Acámica Data Science Bootcamp and Universidad Católica Profesional Python Diploma. 

ii) study notebooks given by the institutions and from other courses I took.

iii) a personal project folder who includes both supervised and unsupervised learning.

iv) data driven business decisions books and data science books I studied since the end of 2020 and during 2021.

The idea of this repository is:

i) share with recruiters the level of knowledge I have in terms of code and also in terms of data driven applications for business.

ii) share with anyone interested in learning this field the one year full time learning path I took.
