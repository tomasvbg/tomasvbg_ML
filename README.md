Hi! I am an analyst with seven years of experience in strategic cabinets, both in the public and private sector. 

For the last few years I have been focused on the analysis and creation of technological business models. At the beginning of 2021 I decided to acquire the necessary mathematical and computational tools and skills to enhance my analysis capacity. I am currently preparing the AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty so that I can demonstrate my ability to build, train, tune, and deploy machine learning models using the AWS Cloud.

This folder contains:
 
i) jupyter homework notebooks I have done this 2021 within the framework of the different courses I have taken in Acámica Data Science Bootcamp and Universidad Católica Profesional Python Diploma. 

ii) study notebooks given by the institutions and from other courses I took.

iii) a personal project folder who includes both supervised and unsupervised learning.

iv) data driven business decisions books and data science books I studied since the end of 2020 and during 2021.

The idea of this repository is:

i) share with recruiters the level of knowledge I have in terms of code and also in terms of data driven applications for business.

ii) share with anyone interested in learning this field the one year full time learning path I took.
