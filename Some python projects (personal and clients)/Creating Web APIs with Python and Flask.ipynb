    "In general, consider an API if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your data set is large, making download via FTP unwieldy or resource-intensive.\n",
    "- Your users will need to access your data in real time, such as for display on another website or as part of an application.\n",
    "- Your data changes or is updated frequently.\n",
    "- Your users only need access to a part of the data at any one time.\n",
    "- Your users will need to perform actions other than retrieve data, such as contributing, updating, or deleting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, APIs are not always the best way of sharing data with users. If the size of the data you are providing is relatively small, you can instead provide a “data dump” in the form of a downloadable JSON, XML, CSV, or SQLite file. Depending on your resources, this approach can be viable up to a download size of a few gigabytes."

    "### 1.2 API Terminologyapi-terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "When using or building APIs, you will encounter these terms frequently:\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the primary means of communicating data on the web. HTTP implements a number of “methods,” which tell which direction data is moving and what should happen to it. The two most common are GET, which pulls data from a server, and POST, which pushes new data to a server.\n",
    "- URL (Uniform Resource Locator) - An address for a resource on the web, such as https://programminghistorian.org/about. A URL consists of a protocol (http://), domain (programminghistorian.org), and optional path (/about). A URL describes the location of a specific resource, such as a web page. When reading about APIs, you may see the terms URL, request, URI, or endpoint used to describe adjacent ideas. This tutorial will prefer the terms URL and request to avoid complication. You can follow a URL or make a GET request in your browser, so you won’t need any special software to make requests in this tutorial.\n",
    "- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text-based data storage format that is designed to be easy to read for both humans and machines. JSON is generally the most common format for returning data through an API, XML being the second most common.\n",
    "- REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a philosophy that describes some best practices for implementing APIs. APIs designed with some or all of these principles in mind are called REST APIs. While the API outlined in this lesson uses some REST principles, there is a great deal of disagreement around this term. For this reason, I do not describe the example APIs here as REST APIs, but instead as web or HTTP APIs.\n"

For our purposes, the most important thing about REST is that it’s based on the four methods defined by the HTTP protocol: POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE. These correspond to the four traditional actions performed on data in a database: CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE. In this tutorial, we’ll only be concerned with GET requests, which correspond to reading from a database.\n",

That means that the word “get” should not appear in our request, since “get” is implied by the fact that we’re using a HTTP GET method. In addition, resource collections such as books or users should be denoted with plural nouns. This makes it clear when an API is referring to a collection (books) or an entry (book). Incorporating these principles, our API would look like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "Without documentation, even the best-designed API will be unusable. Your API should have documentation describing the resources or functionality available through your API that also provides concrete working examples of request URLs or code for your API. You should have a section for each resource that describes which fields, such as id or title, it accepts. Each section should have an example in the form of a sample HTTP request or block of code.\n",

These tools create documentation from docstrings—comments you make on your function definitions. While this kind of documentation is a good idea, you shouldn’t consider your job done if you’ve only documented your API to this level. Instead, try to imagine yourself as a potential user of your API and provide working examples. In an ideal world, you would have three kinds of documentation for your API: a reference that details each route and its behavior, a guide that explains the reference in prose, and at least one or two tutorials that explain every step in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "For inspiration on how to approach API documentation, see the New York Public Library Digital Collections API, which sets a standard of documentation achievable for many academic projects. For an extensively documented (though sometimes overwhelming) API, see the MediaWiki Action API, which provides documentation to users who pass partial queries to the API. (In our example above, we returned an error on a partial query.) For other professionally maintained API documentation examples, consider the World Bank API, the various New York Times APIs, or the Europeana Pro API.\n",

If the visualization were created in D3 or another web-based utility, this plot would actually reflect additional data added to the book archive as soon as the archive was updated—that is, in real time. As additional data accrued, we might, for example, learn if John Scalzi’s unusually lengthy opening to his 2013 Red Shirts was an aberration or the continuation of a longer trend toward wordiness in science fiction. Conversely, if your API were to change its URL structure or cease to function, applications based on it will no longer work. Remember that, when creating an API, you are assuming some responsibility for the applications that others may build with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong API can be considered the backbone of a potentially limitless number of projects or avenues of research. Though the above example takes the form of a visualization of the limited amount of data we’ve provided in our Distant Reading Archive, a project based on this API might just as easily take the form of a Twitterbot that shares first sentences (learn how to make one with this Programming Historian lesson) or a library webpage that displays book openings and year of publication alongside other book metadata. In many cases, it makes sense to first create an API interface to your core data or functionality before extrapolating on it to create a visualization, application, or website. Not only does it make your work accessible to researchers working on other projects, but it often leads to a more comprehensible and maintainable project."
